##Credits

This theme is based on the Cinnamon theme "Faience+" by bimsebasse 
which is a port of the original "Faience" Gnome Shell theme by tiheum.
All credits go to these authors for their work!

##Features

I have modified the theme to match Linux Mint's green color scheme
instead of Faience's blue tone.

##Contribute

It may not yet be complete as I have yet to work through all of the 
theme's css, but for my particular setup I have not recognized 
missing parts so far.
If you find something that does not fit in well don't mind telling me
or contributing to the theme directly on Github :-)
